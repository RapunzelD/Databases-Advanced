For the subject Databases Advanced, I have created a scraper that will scrape the highest bitcoin hash value of the first minute of running the scraper.
This value will be stored in a Mongo Database and will be cached with Redis. 

Press the "RUN" to start the scraper. To stop the scraper from running press "Interupt Kernel".
